\usage{

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Species}{A vector containing the species to query.}

\item{WriteFile}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the occurrence data will be written to the \code{Occs} folder. If \code{FALSE}, the occurrence data will be returned in a list.}

\item{continent}{what contintent are the occurrences downloaded from}

\item{Log}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, a log file will be created with information on the progress of the function.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the \code{occ_data} function.}

\value{
If \code{WriteFile = TRUE}, this function does not return anything. If \code{WriteFile = FALSE}, a list containing the occurrence data for each species is returned.
}
\description{
This function uses the \code{rgbif} package to get occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) API.
